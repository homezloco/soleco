## Detailed Analysis

### MIT License

**Pros:**
- Simple and easy to understand (only ~170 words)
- Highly permissive with minimal restrictions
- Compatible with most other licenses
- Widely adopted in the open source community
- Allows commercial use with minimal obligations
- Preferred by developers for its simplicity

**Cons:**
- No explicit patent protection
- Limited protection against commercial exploitation

- May allow competitors to create closed-source derivatives

**Best for:**
- Projects seeking maximum adoption
- Libraries and tools meant to be widely used
- Projects where simplicity is valued over legal protections

**Impact on Monetization:**
- Allows for an open core model
- Compatible with commercial licensing for premium features
- No restrictions on commercial use of the open source code

### Apache License 2.0

**Pros:**
- Explicit patent protection clause
- Allows commercial use and modification
- Requires preservation of copyright notices
- More legally comprehensive than MIT
- Well-respected in enterprise environments
- Compatible with many other licenses

**Cons:**
- More complex and longer than MIT
- Slightly more restrictive than MIT
- Requires explicit attribution of changes

**Best for:**
- Projects with significant intellectual property concerns

- Projects where patent protection is important

**Impact on Monetization:**
- Well-suited for open core model
- Provides better protection for commercial interests
- Allows for dual licensing strategies

### GNU General Public License v3 (GPL)

**Pros:**
- Strong copyleft provisions ensure derivatives remain open source

- Many companies have policies against using AGPL software
- Can significantly limit adoption
- Incompatible with many other licenses

**Best for:**
- Server-side applications where preventing proprietary SaaS offerings is important

**Impact on Monetization:**
- Well-suited for dual licensing strategies (companies may pay for non-AGPL license)
- May significantly limit adoption without commercial license
- Can be effective for "open source but not free" strategies

### Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL)

**Pros:**

- Projects where only direct modifications should remain open

**Impact on Monetization:**
- Compatible with open core model
- Allows for commercial use with fewer restrictions than GPL
- Supports various monetization strategies

### Business Source License (BSL)

**Pros:**
- Time-delayed open source (becomes open source after a specified period)
- Prevents commercial competition during the restricted period
- Allows eventual transition to a fully open source license
- Provides temporary commercial advantage

**Cons:**
- Not recognized as open source by OSI
- Less community adoption and understanding
- More complex to implement
- May deter some contributors

**Best for:**
- Commercial products transitioning to open source
- Projects seeking to prevent direct commercial competition
- Companies wanting both open source benefits and commercial protection

**Impact on Monetization:**
- Directly supports commercial interests
- Prevents competitors from offering commercial services initially
- Provides time advantage for monetization

## Recommendation for Soleco

Based on Soleco's goals of balancing open source community adoption with monetization potential, we recommend considering:

### Primary Recommendation: **Apache License 2.0**

The Apache License 2.0 provides a good balance of:
- Permissiveness for wide adoption
- Patent protection for intellectual property
- Enterprise acceptability
- Compatibility with open core business model
- Support for dual licensing strategies

This license would allow Soleco to build a strong open source community while protecting commercial interests and enabling various monetization strategies.

### Alternative Recommendation: **MIT License with Dual Licensing**

If simplicity and maximum adoption are priorities, the MIT License with a clear dual licensing strategy for premium features could also be effective. This approach would:
- Maximize adoption of the core platform
- Simplify licensing for contributors
- Still allow for commercial premium features
- Require very clear separation between open and premium features

## Dual Licensing Considerations

Regardless of the primary open source license chosen, Soleco should consider implementing a dual licensing strategy:

1. **Open Source License** (Apache 2.0 or MIT) for the core functionality
2. **Commercial License** for premium features, enterprise support, and SLAs

This approach allows:
- Community adoption of the core platform
- Clear monetization path for premium features
- Legal clarity for enterprise customers
- Protection of commercial interests

## Next Steps

1. Consult with legal counsel to confirm the final license selection
2. Clearly document which components are covered by which license
3. Implement proper license headers in all source files
4. Create a clear explanation of the licensing model for contributors and users
